ALGORITHM

After N frames have passed,

1. From the first N frames, calculate the linear velocity of a subject (magnitude + direction).

2. Determine if a resistance is involved (i.e. gravity).

3. Use kinematic equations to determine where the subject should be located in all future frames.

For each of the following frames,

4. Determine the Euclidean distance between the ground truth's location and the predicted subject's location.
*test_net.py's bbox_pred & gt_box should be in the form a 1 x 4 (T?) matrix with (x, y, w, h).

5. If the Euclidean distance exceeds twice the semi-diagonal of the bounding box, subtract from the proposal's score at a rate of N.

6. If the predicted subject's BB and ground truth's BB have an IoU of >0.7, increment the proposal's score at a rate of N.

7. Change the proposal's score at line 24 of /models/components/proposal.py.
