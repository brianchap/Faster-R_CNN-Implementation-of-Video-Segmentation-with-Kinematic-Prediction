# newfunction should:
#   1. Compare values stored in f and i, as well as x and a.
#   2. Find the two subjects of minimal distance and calculate velocity. Remove them
#      from the tensors/arrays. Add the velocity to a tensor (magnitude and direction). Add
#      the pascal_class into an array.
#   3. Repeat step 2 until completed.
#   4. Return the tensor and the array, one for velocities, the other for pascal_class.
