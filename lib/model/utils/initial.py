# newfunction should:
#   1. Compare values stored in f and i, as well as x and a and k and y.
#   2. Find the two subjects of minimal distance and calculate velocity and acceleration.
#      Remove them from the tensors/arrays. Add the velocity and acceleration to four tensors
#      (vx, vy, ax, ay). Add the pascal_class into an array.
#   3. Repeat step 2 until completed.
#   4. Return the tensors and the array.
