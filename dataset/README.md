# Dataset In Progress


As of right now, we are working to create an ideal dataset for the Faster R-CNN with Kinematic Prediction system to run on. 
This will be another training model for the R-CNN to train on in order to accurately track and predict motion of objects using kinematics. 


Within this dataset, we have included vertical drops, tosses, depth transformations away from the camera, and linear motion down a ramp such as slides and rolls of objects. We are currently working toward adding more objects and annotating current data with bounding boxes for training.
